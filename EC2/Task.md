## 🧪 EC2 Practice Tasks

This section contains hands-on practice tasks designed to strengthen practical understanding of **Amazon EC2** through real-world scenarios.

---

### 🔹 Practice 1: Basic Instance Setup

**Task:**  
Launch an EC2 instance using **Amazon Linux** and ensure it is accessible via **SSH**.  
Verify that the instance is reachable and running correctly.

**Focus Areas:**
- AMI selection  
- Instance state  
- Key pair usage  
- Security group basics  

---

### 🔹 Practice 2: Instance Type Understanding

**Task:**  
Launch two EC2 instances using different instance types  
(example: `t2.micro` and `t3.small`) and compare their configurations.

**Focus Areas:**
- Instance families  
- vCPU and RAM differences  
- Cost-awareness  

---

### 🔹 Practice 3: Storage Practice

**Task:**  
Attach an additional **EBS volume** to a running EC2 instance and ensure the data remains intact after stopping and starting the instance.

**Focus Areas:**
- EBS persistence  
- Instance lifecycle  
- Storage behavior  

---

### 🔹 Practice 4: Security Group Scenario

**Task:**  
Configure a security group with the following rules:
- Allow **SSH access** only from your IP address  
- Allow **HTTP access** from anywhere  

Test and validate the access behavior.

**Focus Areas:**
- Inbound rules  
- Stateful firewall behavior  
- Least privilege principle  

---

### 🔹 Practice 5: Elastic IP Concept

**Task:**  
Assign an **Elastic IP** to an EC2 instance and verify that the public IP address does not change after an instance restart.

**Focus Areas:**
- Static vs dynamic IPs  
- Instance restart behavior  

---

### 🔹 Practice 6: Instance Lifecycle

**Task:**  
Perform the following operations on an EC2 instance:
- Start  
- Stop  
- Reboot  
- Terminate  

Observe the changes in instance behavior.

**Focus Areas:**
- Instance state changes  
- Public IP behavior  
- Attached storage impact  
- Lifecycle understanding
